## Monix Scheduler

`monix.execution.Scheduler` is an extension of Scala's `ExecutionContext`.
Internally, `Scheduler` governs a pool of threads and contains a work queue of `Task`s.
When there are tasks to execute, it schedules them to run on one of the available JVM's threads.
After this point, the Operating System is responsible for physically running this thread on CPU at some point.
This also means that using "parallel" operators does not guarantee true parallelism - it depends on the CPU.

`Task` runs on a given thread until it completes or *yields* control back to the `Scheduler`.
Once `yield` happens, the rest of the `Task` will be rescheduled to continue on possibly, but not necessarily a different thread.
This is as an _asynchronous boundary_.

Asynchronous boundaries happen when calling concurrent operators such as `executeAsync`, `shift`, `sleep`, polling
asynchronous data structures, at the beginning of parallel operators, and so on.
The default `ExecutionModel` of `Scheduler` will also introduce automatic asynchronous boundaries every N flatMaps.

These operations will be scheduled on the "default" or a "main" `Scheduler` unless the operator allows the user to explicitly specify a different one.
The default `Scheduler` is provided in one of two ways:
- Passed as a paremeter when running the `Task` with a method like `runToFuture` / `runSyncUnsafe` etc.
- Overwritten for the duration of the given `Task` with `executeOn`.

## Choosing Scheduler

There is rarely a need for many different Schedulers, but many applications have at least two:
- "Main" Scheduler (e.g. `Scheduler.global` or `Scheduler.computation`) for most computations, CPU-bound in particular
- "Blocking" Scheduler (e.g. `Scheduler.io`) for computations which block threads

The main Scheduler aims for maximal utilization of the CPU.
Ideally, we would have a 1 thread per CPU's core that never has to context switch.
For that reason, the recommendation is to use a bounded thread pool with a size equal to the number of CPU's cores.

The blocking Scheduler often has an unbounded, cached thread pool.
If we have a limited thread pool and block all available threads, we might end up with a deadlock when there is no thread left that could execute callbacks to unblock some of them.
The risk is that we might go out of memory if we create too many threads so it's useful to limit the parallelism on a higher level.

## Scheduling

`Scheduler` has three execution models:
- `BatchedExecution` (the default) inserts an asynchronous boundary per N `flatMap` calls.
- `SynchronousExecution` that doesn't insert any asynchronous boundaries on its own.
- `AlwaysAsyncExecution` that inserts asynchronous boundaries on all `flatMaps`.

If we use `SynchronousExecution`, we can look at `flatMap` chains as synchronous steps.

```scala 
import monix.execution.Scheduler
import monix.eval.Task

given Scheduler =
  Scheduler.singleThread("test").withExecutionModel(ExecutionModel.SynchronousExecution)

def forever(i: Int): Task[Unit] = Task(println(i)).flatMap { _ => forever(i) }
```

In this example, we have created a `Scheduler` with only a single thread that uses `SynchronousExecution` model.
Then, we defined `forever` Task, which is making infinite `flatMap` loop.
Let's see what happens if we run two of those tasks concurrently:

```scala 
Task.parZip2(forever(1), forever(2)).runToFuture
```

Output:

```
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
...
```

What could seem surprising at first - only one of the `Task`s is ever executed!
The other one is stuck in the `Scheduler`'s queue because there is only one thread, and the first `Task` never completes, and it never yields back.

If we change the definition of `forever`:

```scala 
def forever(i: Int): Task[Unit] = Task(println(i)).flatMap(_ => forever(i).executeAsync)
```

We will see `1` and `2` interleaved:

``` 
1
2
1
2
1
2
1
2
...
```

This example is a nice demonstration of _fairness_ vs _throughput_ concern.
The code is going to be faster without any asynchronous boundaries (because of fewer context switches), giving us a higher throughput but it won't be fair because some tasks
might wait a long time before having a chance to execute.
